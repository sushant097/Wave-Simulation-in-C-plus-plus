# Wave-Simulation-in-C-plus-plus
### This is The Wave Simulation Program Written in C++ based in "Graphihcs.h" Library which can be run in **Codeblocks**.
This is mainly for educational purposes where you understand how the signal is generated, animated and perform basic computation with it.
If you want to run this code in your machine. I really suggest you to use `codeblocks` with `graphics.h` added in it. In
 Other IDE can also be run but some change should be done.
 
## The sample of output generated by it is: ![Image of Sine and Cosine Wave Addition](https://github.com/sushant097/Wave-Simulation-in-C-plus-plus/blob/master/draw.png)
         
         
**This consists following feature:**

- [x] Generate Square Wave (all based on inputs of Amplitude and Frequency)
- [x] Generate Cosine Wave
- [x] Addition of Sine and Cosine Wave
- [x] Subtraction of Sine and Cosinge Wave
- [x] Generates Other Waves                         
   - [x]  Square Waves
   - [x]  Traingular Waves
- [x] Option to change Font and Background Color as Specified..

**Coding challenge: As the frequency of the signal increases, the signal narrows. However, as the frequency of the square wave is increased, it begins to wider.**
